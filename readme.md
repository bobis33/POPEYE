# EPITECH PROJECT | DEVOPS


### Docker is one of todayâ€™s most popular containerization software.

<p>
  It allows the packaging of applications, and the runtime environments (down to the operating systems)
  they need, which in return allows them to work wherever Docker is installed.
  Like the brave sailor that Popeye is, containers can also confidently sail across the vast ocean of operating
  systems and configurations, being sure of working wherever they might end. As such, containers can be
  used on any host OS where Docker is installed.
  During this project, you are going to master the basics of containerizing applications and describing multi-containers infrastructures with Docker and Docker Compose.
